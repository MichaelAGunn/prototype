Prototype for the Remedy Bible app.

## Plans for this app:
- Any translation that I can access will be downloadable directly to your device.
- You will be able to format the readerspace in many ways:
	- colours
	- chapter & verse numbers
	- font sizes
	- format poetry & prose
- You will be able to save your formatted query as a .pdf for printing.
- There is no copyright on the work. It's in the Public Domain. You will be protected from infringement allegations by exceptions to copyright.
- You will be able to statistically analyze word counts and perform natural language processing tests.
- You will be able to look up the meanings of words from online dictionaries and concordances.
